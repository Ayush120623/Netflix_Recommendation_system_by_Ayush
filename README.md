Built a recommendation system to predict user ratings for movies using collaborative filtering. The model analyzes user-item interaction patterns to suggest personalized movie recommendations based on previous viewing behavior and preferences.

# Tools Used:

1. scikit-surprise for collaborative filtering and SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)

2. Python for scripting and data handling

3. Google Colab for cloud-based execution

4. Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing and manipulation

5. Cross-validation for model evaluation

# Result:

Achieved reliable accuracy with RMSE below 1.0 on the MovieLens ml-100k dataset

Generated personalized movie recommendations for new users

Laid the foundation for scalable recommendation systems for streaming platforms like Netflix
